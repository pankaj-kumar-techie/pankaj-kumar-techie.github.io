# Pankaj Kumar — Systems Architect Portfolio

This repository powers my personal portfolio website, built to reflect how I design **real-world software systems**:  
clear, durable, scalable, and outcome-driven.

🌐 **Live Site:** https://pankaj-kumar-techie.github.io/

## Why This Portfolio Exists

This is not a flashy UI demo or a collection of buzzwords.

It is a **deliberate, minimal system** that communicates how I think, build, and collaborate as a **Systems Architect**.

Every decision—from content structure to deployment—mirrors how I approach production software:
- clarity over cleverness  
- stability over hype  
- systems over tools

## What This Site Communicates

Visitors should understand, within seconds:

- How I think about **architecture and ownership**
- What kind of problems I solve **best**
- What it feels like to **work with me**
- Why durability and scale are non-negotiable

This site is intentionally story-driven, like a **technical trailer**, not a résumé.
