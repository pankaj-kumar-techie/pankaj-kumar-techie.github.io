# Engineering Principles

These principles guide how I architect, build, and maintain scalable systems. They are designed to create long-term impact, ensure stability, and empower teams to achieve more.

## 1. Radical Ownership
I don't just write code; I own the journey from concept to impact.
- I understand the "why" before the "how".
- I anticipate failure modes and edge cases proactively.
- Documentation and durability are first-class citizens—systems should outlive my tenure.

## 2. Systems Over Frameworks
Frameworks come and go. Systems last.
- Focus on durable patterns: low-coupling, modularity, and scalability.
- Build on stable foundations: PostgreSQL, Linux, standard protocols.
- Frameworks are tools, not crutches.

## 3. Stability is a Feature
Reliability is as important as innovation.
- Production-readiness is non-negotiable from Day 1.
- Observability, monitoring, and testing are baked in, not afterthoughts.
- A fast product that crashes is a liability, not an achievement.

## 4. Clear Communication
Complexity should never block clarity.
- I bridge technical teams and stakeholders with jargon-free updates.
- Code is written for humans first, machines second.
- Decisions are shared transparently to prevent surprises.

## 5. Cost-Aware Architecture
Every decision has a financial footprint.
- Systems must scale efficiently in compute and cost.
- I aim for "Minimum Viable Complexity" but ensure the system can grow when required.
- Long-term maintainability and flexibility guide architectural choices.
